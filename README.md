Changing CSS variables (blur, spacing, color) with vanilla JS

In this project I declared variables (--base: #ffc600, --spacing: 10px, --blur: 10px) and then assigned them to different elements. I then created a function named 'handleUpdate()' that changes the property. Finally I added event listeners 'change' and 'mousemove' to ensure the tools coincide with the changes being made on the page.

This is day 3 of Wes Bos' JavaScript 30 challenge!
